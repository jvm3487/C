Step 1 -
f = 2
s = 2
j = 3
c = 1
r = 1
u = 2
q = 1
t = 1
k = 1
y = 2
m = 1
n = 1
z = 1

j is e

Step 3 -
Initialized an array for all 26 letters in the alphabet
Looked at each letter in the sequence and added one to that element of the array
Looked at which element contained the largest value
Outputed that as e
