Step 1 - work an example yourself

The 5th Fibonacci number
1= first Fibonacci #
0+1=1 2nd Fibonacci #
1+1=2 3rd Fibonacci #
1+2=3 4th
3+2=5 5th

Step 2 - write down exactly what you did
2 numbers previous + previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous = previous number
previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous + previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous = previous number
previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous + previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous = previous number
previous number = Fibonacci number
2 numbers previous + previous number = Fibonacci number

Step 3 - generalize
secondPrev = 0
firstPrev = 1
if number is negative or 0 answer is 0
if number is 1 answer is 1
if number is 2 or more
Repeat the following process to reach result (i=0 corresponds to 2nd Fibonacci #)
secondPrev + firstPrev = fibNumber
secondPrev = firstPrev
firstPrev = fibNumber

Step 4
secondPrev = 0
firstPrev = 1
fibNumber = 1
secondPrev = 1
firstPrev = 1
fibNumber = 2
secondPrev = 1
firstPrev = 2
fibNumber = 3
secondPrev = 2
firstPrev = 3
fibNumber = 5
secondPrev = 3
fristPrev = 5
fibNumber = 8

if input is 0 -> needs to return 0
if input is 1 -> needs to return 1
if input is negative -> needs to return 0
