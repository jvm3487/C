Step 1 - work an example yourself
Factor 40
2 * 20
2 * 2 * 10
2 * 2 * 2 * 5

Step 2 - write down exactly what you did
Determined if 40 is prime
If it wasn't, determined the smallest prime number that went into 40
Determined if the remaining factor was prime
If it wasn't determined the smallest prime number that went into 20x

Step 3 - generalize
isPrime?
determine smallest prime number that can divide into it
print that number followed by a space and a *
isPrime?
determine smallest prime number that can divide into it
etc.
when number isPrime -> print that number

Step 4 - test
12
no
2 *
no
2 * 2 * 3
yes
