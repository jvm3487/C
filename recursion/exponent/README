Classwork 7, Problem 2
=======================

For this problem, you will a program to compute exponents. 
Specifically, you will edit "exp.c" to write two functions:

long power(long x, long y);

   and

int main(void);


The first of these will compute x raised to the y power (long is just like int,
but may or may not have a larger range depending on the system). For example,
if given x = 2, y = 4, this function would return 16 (2 to the 4th).

You must write the "power" function using recursion: you may not use any
loops (for, while, or do-while) in the power function.


For main, you will write a loop which reads a line (from stdin, using getline), which has
the format x^y (where x and y are numbers).  It will then pull out the two numbers,
compute x to the y power (using the power function you are writing), and print out the
result (Note that "%ld" is the proper format for a long).  Your program should
repeat this proceess until end of file.

If the format of the line is not correct, your program should print an error message
to stderr, ignore the input, and read another line.  Your program may strictly
require "number^number\n" for the input string.  You will likely want to use
strtol for these conversions. 

You can test your program by using the "bc" shell command, which is a command line
calculator.   If you run bc, and type expressions, it will compute the result and
print it back.  bc has much more capability and flexibility than your program, but you
can use it to compute the right results to check your work.


As always, be sure to valgrind cleanly.

When you are done, commit exp.c
