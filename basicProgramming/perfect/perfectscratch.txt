Step 1 - work an example
27
1, 3, 9, 27
1 + 3 + 9 =13
not perfect

Step 2 - write down exactly what you did
listed 1 as the first number
counted all numbers from 2 to 27-1 to see which numbers divide evenly into it
added all of those numbers to one to get the value to check
checked that value against the number to determine if it was perfect

Step 3 - generalize
perfectSum = 1
check if n>1 -> if not, it is not perfect
checked 2 to n-1 to see if they divide evenly
if they do
perfectSum = 1 + evenDivisor
repeat unitl n-1 is reached
does perfectSum = n
if yes return 1
if no return 0

Step 4 - test
28
perfectSum = 1
1 + 2 = 3
3 + 4 = 7
7 + 7 = 14
14 + 14 = 28
return 1

corner cases
n > 1 for the algorithm to function properly
